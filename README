To compile: 
    make all -> ppmdiff, 40image, testbit
    make ppmdiff -> ppmdiff
    make 40image -> 40image
    make testbit -> testbit
    make clean -> removes ppmdiff 40image testbit executables

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

40image commands
        to compress -> ./40image -c [ppm filename] -> Compressed image format
      to decompress -> ./40image -d [compressed image] -> decompress ppm file 

ppmdiff commands
        to compare -> ./ppmdiff [ppm image 1] [ppm image 2]

testbit commands
        to test -> ./testbit -> if no errors occur, nothing is printed out
                                and EXIT_SUCCESS is returned
                                if error occurs, assertion will be raised

Architecture:
    compress40.c:   This contains the implementation for compress and
                    decompression. Relies on UArray2b, a2plain methods
                    and used Bitpack.c for bitpacking the compressed data
                    into words that are printed.

    a2plain.c:  This is the methods suite for the uarray2 interface.
                In this implementation we only support unblocked arrays.
                (no unblocked implementation exists in this directory) 

    40image.c:  This contains the main for compression and decompression.
                This file also handles the command line args, and opening
                files

    bitpack.c: This is the implementation of bitpack. It performs field
               extraction, field update, and width test functions on a word. 
                   The primary role of bitpack is to abstract bitpacking and
                   unpacking to be used within compress40.c.

    bitpack.h: This is the interface of bitpack. It performs field
               extraction, field update, and width test functions on a word.
                   The primary role of bitpack is to abstract bitpacking and 
                   unpacking to be used within compress40.c.

    ppmdiff.c: This program takes two ppm images and returns (as a percent)
               how different they are. Relies on uarray2 for array
               representation of pixels in images. Uses math provided in
               arith spec for calculating the difference

    testBit.c: This is a test main for our bitpacking functions. We validate
               the outputs of each function within bitpack by performing the
                   same operations by hand, and assert that the value returned 
               from the functions matches our computed values by hand.

    uarray2.c: This is a 2D implementation of Hansons Unboxed
               Arrays. The UArray2 handles mapping, dimension getting, and 
               memory allocation/freeing.

    uarray2.h: This is a 2D interface of Hansons Unboxed
               Arrays. The UArray2 handles mapping, dimension getting, and 
               memory allocation/freeing.
